> "DHSampling: Diversity-based Hyperedge Sampling in GNN Learning with Application to Medical Image Classification", Workshop on _MLMI_, _MICCAI 2024_, [Jiameng Liu, Furkan Pala, <u>Islem Rekik</u>, and <u>Dinggang Shen</u>]


### Install

* Clone this repo and install corresponding requirement in `requirements.txt`

    `git clone https://github.com/basiralab/DHSampling.git`
  
    `pip install -r requirements`

### Data Preparation
We train and validate our proposed DHSampling on two publicly available MedMNIST data (_i.e._,OrganCMNIST, OrganSMNIST)

***
This implementation is highly inspired by _ClusterGCN_ in this [Repo](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/ClusterGCN)
